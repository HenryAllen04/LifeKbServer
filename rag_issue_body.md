## ðŸŽ¯ Feature Request: RAG Integration

### Current State âœ…
We have a **privacy-first pure semantic search** system that:
- Returns raw journal entries with similarity scores
- Keeps all data in our database (never sent to LLMs)
- Provides fast ~50ms search responses  
- Low cost ($0.0004 per search)
- Complete user control over interpretation

### Proposed Enhancement ðŸš€
Add **optional RAG mode** alongside existing search for users who want AI-generated insights.

### RAG Implementation Plan

#### 1. New API Endpoint
```
POST /api/search/rag
{
  "query": "when was the last time I burned out?",
  "mode": "conversational", // or "summary", "analysis"
  "include_sources": true
}
```

#### 2. Expected Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "query": "when was the last time I burned out?",
  "ai_response": "Based on your journal entries, you last mentioned feeling burned out on March 15th, 2024. You described feeling 'completely exhausted and overwhelmed at work.' This followed a pattern of increasing stress over 2 weeks...",
  "sources": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "text": "I'm completely exhausted...",
      "created_at": "2024-03-15T10:30:00Z",
      "similarity": 0.824
    }
  ],
  "processing_time_ms": 2150
}
```

#### 3. Technical Implementation

**Search Pipeline:**
1. **Semantic Search** (existing) â†’ relevant entries
2. **Context Preparation** â†’ format entries for LLM
3. **LLM Request** â†’ OpenAI GPT-4 with context
4. **Response Processing** â†’ structured response with sources

**Code Structure:**
```python
# api/search_rag.py
def perform_rag_search(user_id: str, query: str, mode: str):
    # 1. Use existing semantic search
    search_results = perform_semantic_search(user_id, query)
    
    # 2. Prepare LLM context
    context = format_entries_for_llm(search_results)
    
    # 3. Call LLM with privacy-aware prompt
    llm_response = call_openai_chat(query, context, mode)
    
    # 4. Return structured response
    return format_rag_response(llm_response, search_results)
```

#### 4. Privacy & Control Features

**User Consent:**
- Explicit opt-in required for RAG mode
- Clear warning: "This will send your journal entries to OpenAI"
- Per-query consent or user preference setting

**Data Minimization:**
- Only send relevant entries (not entire journal)
- Strip sensitive metadata if possible
- Use privacy-focused prompts

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Default: Pure semantic search (current behavior)
- Optional: RAG mode for users who want AI insights
- Always include source entries for transparency

#### 5. Cost & Performance Considerations

| Aspect | Current Search | RAG Mode |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Speed** | ~50ms | ~2-5s |
| **Cost** | $0.0004/search | $0.01-0.05/query |
| **Privacy** | High | Medium |
| **Value** | Raw data | AI insights |

#### 6. Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Core RAG**
- [ ] New `/api/search/rag` endpoint
- [ ] OpenAI GPT integration
- [ ] Basic conversational responses
- [ ] Source attribution

**Phase 2: Advanced Features**
- [ ] Multiple response modes (summary, analysis, Q&A)
- [ ] User preference settings
- [ ] Response caching for common queries
- [ ] Custom prompt templates

**Phase 3: Enhanced Experience**
- [ ] Streaming responses for long answers
- [ ] Follow-up question suggestions
- [ ] Conversation history
- [ ] Export RAG insights

#### 7. Example Use Cases

**Temporal Queries:**
- "When was the last time I felt anxious?"
- "How has my mood changed over the past month?"
- "What were my main concerns in 2024?"

**Pattern Analysis:**
- "What activities make me happiest?"
- "What triggers my stress?"
- "How do I typically handle difficult situations?"

**Insight Generation:**
- "What lessons have I learned this year?"
- "What are my recurring themes?"
- "How have I grown as a person?"

#### 8. Success Metrics
- [ ] User adoption rate of RAG vs pure search
- [ ] User satisfaction with AI-generated insights
- [ ] Response accuracy and relevance
- [ ] Performance impact on system

### Technical Requirements
- OpenAI GPT-4 API integration
- Prompt engineering for personal journal context
- User consent flow implementation
- Response caching system
- Error handling for LLM failures

### Security Considerations
- Audit trail for data sent to OpenAI
- User data retention policies with LLM providers
- Rate limiting for expensive RAG queries
- Fallback to pure search if RAG fails

### Documentation Updates Needed
- API documentation for new RAG endpoints
- User guide for RAG vs pure search
- Privacy policy updates
- Cost implications for users

---

**Priority:** Medium (Enhancement)
**Effort:** Large (~2-3 sprints)
**Dependencies:** OpenAI API integration, user consent system

This would make LifeKB a **hybrid system** - privacy-first by default, with optional AI-powered insights for users who want them! ðŸŽ‰
